# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- The free functions in `coreforecast.rolling`, `coreforecast.expanding` and
  `coreforecast.exponentially_weighted` now preserve a leading run of NaNs and
  compute the statistic over what follows it. They used to return all NaN as
  soon as the series started with one. With `skipna=True`, `min_samples` counts
  positions after that run, which is what pandas does. The seasonal variants
  split what follows the run into seasons, so a leading run whose length isn't a
  multiple of `season_length` now groups different positions together than it
  used to.
- Input without a float dtype (integer arrays, lists, Series) is now widened to
  float64 instead of float32. Values from `2**24` on were silently rounded
  before; the result now takes twice the memory. Pass a float32 array to get
  float32 back, which was already the only way to be sure of it.
- Arguments that used to read or write out of bounds are rejected with a
  `ValueError` or an `IndexError` instead: non-positive `window_size`,
  `min_samples` and `season_length`, negative `lag`, `d` and `k`, quantile
  levels outside `[0, 1]`, `indptr` entries that are negative, decreasing or
  too large for an int32, out-of-range group indices, and `ds`, `stats`,
  `periods` and `tails` arrays whose size doesn't match the group count.
  Calling `update` on a lag transform built with `lag=0` also raises now: an
  update reads the value that isn't in the array yet, so there is nothing for
  it to consume.

### Bug fixes

- `LocalBoxCoxScaler.stats_` had an uninitialised second column: the lambda
  kernels write one value per group and the array holding them was never
  cleared. Transforms were unaffected since that column is not read, but the
  attribute differed between identical fits. It is now zero.

### Documentation

- The local scalers' `skipna` documentation said an interior NaN "may result in
  NaN statistics". It doesn't for min-max, where the result is whichever value
  wins an unordered comparison. With `skipna=False` only a leading run of NaNs
  is supported; pass `skipna=True` for anything else.
